# Stroke-prediction-LogisticRegretion

In this project, we explored a variety of metrics within a logistic regression model. The aim was to experiment with new techniques using a relatively straightforward dataset. The project yielded insights and lessons, leading to the following key takeaways:

Visuals: Excessive graphical representation isn't always necessary. Often, a histogram or correlation heatmap is sufficient to comprehend trends.

Model Choice: The logistic regression model, while providing decent results, demonstrated limitations due to its lower complexity compared to more powerful algorithms.

Imbalanced Data: The dataset encountered a significant challenge due to an imbalance between stroke and non-stroke cases. Despite efforts to balance the data, this imbalance remained a considerable factor.

Personal Growth: The project proved rewarding, encompassing approximately 8-9 hours of research, debugging, interactions with ChatGPT, and hands-on coding. Gaining an understanding of BMI and glucose levels added to the enriching experience.
